## Introduction

Yelp is one of the most popular apps for finding new places.It also offers reviews and recommendations of restaurants, cafes, and more.Natural Language Processing is being used to build a system that can detect the sentiments in restaurants and cafes reviews.
This system can help restaurants and cafes determine which aspects are positive and which are negative, so they can make improvements. In addition, build a recommendation system that shows similar restaurants and cafes based on the customer's preferences.
